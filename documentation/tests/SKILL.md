# Playwright Automation Documentation

Use this skill to improve readability of existing Playwright code.

## Workflow

1. Read the target test file or support module first.
2. Identify where comments would materially help a future maintainer.
3. Add concise documentation at the file, suite, test, fixture, or helper level as appropriate.

## Commenting Rules

- Prefer high-signal docblocks over line-by-line narration.
- Explain intent, scope, or non-obvious behavior.
- Do not restate code that is already obvious from the test title or method name.
- Avoid comment spam in straightforward tests.

## Output

After editing, summarize:

- what was documented,
- why those locations mattered,
- any parts of the suite that are still hard to understand and may need refactoring rather than more comments.
