# Playwright Root Cause Analysis

Use this skill when a failure needs explanation, not just rerunning.

## Inputs

- failing test output,
- trace artifacts, screenshots, videos, or HTML reports when available,
- related console, network, or application logs,
- recent code or requirement changes if they help explain the failure.

## Analysis Workflow

1. Identify the failing assertion or stopping point.
2. Reconstruct what the app and test were each expecting.
3. Classify the issue as likely `product bug`, `test defect`, `environment issue`, or `possible flake`.
4. Support the classification with concrete evidence.

## Output Contract

Provide:

- `Failure`
- `Most likely cause`
- `Classification`
- `Evidence`
- `Recommended next action`
- `Confidence`

## Guardrails

- Do not claim certainty when the evidence is mixed.
- Separate observation from hypothesis.
- If the right answer is "needs reproduction with more data," say that directly.
