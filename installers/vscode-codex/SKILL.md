## Setup Workflow

1. Confirm Node.js, npm, and VS Code are installed.
2. Initialize or inspect the Playwright project.
3. Configure the editor extensions or agent workflow the user actually has available.
4. Verify the environment can run Playwright tests locally.
5. Point the user to the relevant skills in this repository for ongoing work.

## Output Contract

Provide:

- prerequisites,
- setup steps,
- verification commands,
- any editor-specific caveats,
- the next recommended skill or guide after setup.
