description: Browser-automation skill for terminal-driven Playwright work. Use when the agent needs to navigate websites, inspect pages, interact with forms, capture screenshots or traces, manage browser sessions, mock requests, or generate test code through a local `playwright-cli` workflow instead of writing a full test first.

# Playwright CLI

Use this skill when terminal-driven browser automation is the fastest path.

## Assumptions

- A local `playwright-cli` installation is available.
- If command names differ by version, inspect local help output before assuming an exact subcommand shape.

## Operating Rules

1. Snapshot or inspect the page before interacting with referenced elements.
2. Prefer deterministic session naming for parallel or long-running work.
3. Save and restore auth state deliberately when login is expensive.
4. Capture traces before reproducing a failure, not after.
5. Drop into custom code only when the built-in command surface is not enough.
