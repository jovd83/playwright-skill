# Playwright Coverage Plan Generation

Use this skill after the requirements are clear enough to plan against.

## Prerequisites

- Start from confirmed requirements or a clearly labeled analysis baseline.
- If major assumptions remain, keep them visible in the plan instead of burying them.

## Planning Rules

- Aim for meaningful functional completeness, not mechanical scenario inflation.
- Cover the paths that change confidence: core success paths, important variations, failure handling, boundary conditions, and permissions or role differences when relevant.
- Avoid duplicate scenarios that test the same risk with different wording.
- Choose the lowest-cost execution type that still validates the behavior well.

## Output Contract

Produce a coverage plan table like this:

| Priority | Requirement ID | Scenario | Coverage Type | Execution Type | Risk Covered | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

Use `Coverage Type` values such as `happy-path`, `variation`, `negative`, `edge`, or `resilience` when helpful.

## Execution-Type Guidance

- `UI`: use for end-user behavior, visual flow, or browser-only interactions.
- `API`: use when the behavior can be validated more directly and more cheaply through service calls.
- `Component`: use for isolated UI states or highly focused component behavior.
- Mixed strategies are valid when one requirement needs more than one confidence layer.

## Scope Control

- High-value or logic-heavy features usually need more than one scenario.
- Simple static content often needs only one direct verification.
- Do not omit important unhappy paths just to keep the plan short.
- Do not add low-signal permutations just to make the plan look comprehensive.

## Next Step

Use dispatcher intent `review_playwright_coverage_plan` when explicit review or sign-off is needed before implementation or documentation.
