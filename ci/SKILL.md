# Playwright CI

Use this skill when the main problem is pipeline execution rather than test authoring.

## CI Standards

1. Prefer deterministic setup over clever pipeline shortcuts.
2. Capture traces, screenshots, and reports where they help triage failures quickly.
3. Scale horizontally with sharding before over-sizing single runners.
4. Cache browser binaries and other stable dependencies deliberately.
5. Keep CI retries informative, not silent flake camouflage.

## Output Bias

When solving CI tasks, prefer:

- concrete workflow or pipeline changes,
- exact commands and cache locations,
- artifact and failure-diagnostics recommendations,
- explicit tradeoffs when the pipeline needs faster feedback versus deeper debugging.
