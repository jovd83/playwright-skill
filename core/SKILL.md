description: Core Playwright implementation skill for resilient test authoring and debugging. Use when the agent needs practical Playwright guidance for locators, assertions, fixtures, authentication, network behavior, API testing, component testing, debugging, framework-specific recipes, or broader test architecture decisions.

# Playwright Core

Use this skill for day-to-day Playwright implementation work. It is the foundation of the pack and should be the default path when the user wants tests written, fixed, or reviewed.

## Core Standards

1. Prefer `getByRole()` and other user-facing locators over brittle selectors.
2. Prefer web-first assertions over manual sleeps or ad hoc polling.
3. Keep tests isolated and independent of execution order.
4. Use `baseURL`, fixtures, and reusable setup instead of hardcoded environment drift.
5. Mock external dependencies selectively; do not mask the system under test without a reason.
6. Choose the lightest test type that still validates the real risk.

## Scope

- Use this skill for implementation guidance and debugging patterns.
- Move to [../pom/SKILL.md](../pom/SKILL.md) when the main problem is test architecture ownership.
- Move to [../ci/SKILL.md](../ci/SKILL.md) when the main problem is pipeline execution.
