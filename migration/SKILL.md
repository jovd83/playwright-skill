description: Migration skill for moving existing UI automation to Playwright. Use when the agent needs to translate Cypress or Selenium/WebDriver patterns, plan incremental migration, preserve coverage during framework change, or explain architectural differences that affect the suite design.

# Playwright Migration

Use this skill when the user is moving from another browser automation stack to Playwright.

## Migration Workflow

1. Inventory the existing suite structure, runner assumptions, and shared helpers.
2. Map framework concepts to the Playwright equivalents.
3. Choose an incremental migration path that preserves confidence.
4. Revisit architecture decisions such as fixtures, waiting, locators, and CI once the syntax translation is done.

## Guides

| Source framework | Guide |
|---|---|
| Cypress | [from-cypress.md](from-cypress.md) |
| Selenium / WebDriver | [from-selenium.md](from-selenium.md) |

## Output Bias

Prefer migration plans, translated examples, and architecture notes over abstract comparisons.
